# hw8

I believe I earned a C on the midterm project. I liked my background and my concept, but I think more motion/interaction could have been involved and I was unable to get in background music.

I will have the video of my arduino on Sunday. Unfortunately, the hybrid lab was closed every time I got off of work/class I apologize for the inconvinience.
